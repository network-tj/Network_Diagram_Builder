# Network-DiagramBuild
The intent of this repo is to store scripts that will help build a network diagram.  This is helpful for MSP / MSSP environments where multiple clients need diagrams on a regular basis.  The goal is to help speed up the process.  You may still want to build a nice looking diagram, but having scripts to help compile the data needed to do so will help.
